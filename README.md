Programming is too broad. It is not possible I collect all useful materials. 

When I find any great online documents, text books, etc, I will update them here. 

A lot of people are doing the same thing!

[vhf/free-programming-books: Freely available programming books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books)

##### Mac Developer

- [Mac OS X Setup Guide](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/)

  Things you need to do with a new Mac. 
  
- [Mac developer must-haves](https://gist.github.com/erikreagan/3259442)

  Some of them are obsolete. I am going to test all of them (or find some alternatives). 


##### Others

- [_The Linux Command Line_](http://linuxcommand.org/index.php)

 > Learn the Linux command line. Write shell scripts.
 
- Google 
 
 It's not possible that we list all guides. If you need any introduction, type "%s introduction" and you will find it in the very first page. For example, [A Really, Really, Really Good Introduction to XML](http://www.sitepoint.com/really-good-introduction-xml/).
