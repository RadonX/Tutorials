### FlaskApp


- [Creating a Web App From Scratch Using Python Flask and MySQL - Tuts+ Code Tutorials](http://code.tutsplus.com/series/creating-a-web-app-from-scratch-using-python-flask-and-mysql--cms-827)
 
 This is a very detailed 8-course series. And I love it. 
 It will be a simple bucket list application where users can register, sign in and create their bucket list. The tutorial uses Flask, a Python web application framework, to create the application, with MySQL as the back end.

>I am in part 4 of the tutorial now. 
Since Jay didnot uploaded the necessary sql files, I have added `BucketList.sql`, which includes the tables and procedures needed. I have inserted no values into the database. You can do this either using sql or manipulating in the web application. 
I fixed the bug of len of `user_password` in `BucketList.tbl_user`. The original length cannot handle hashed password.
